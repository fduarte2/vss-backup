This directory is the housing of the vessel productivity report pages.

Only the .php files are necessary to the operation of these scripts.

All of the xls files have been going to the wrong directory.  They are going to the webroot directory (/web/web_pages).

At this time (Jan 18, 2007) the only XLS files that go to that directory are from this program.  So I feel safe in saying if you want to remove 
files from that area, go ahead. 

Or don't, and keep them to go back to if necessary.

The scripts work as is, so rather than try and "fix" this, I'm going to let it go as is.
