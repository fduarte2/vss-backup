All of the xls documents in this folder are being generated by the Vessel Productivity Program (./supervisors/productivity_report_pages).

They are not necessary for operation, and may be deleted at will if sanity of file stucture is in question.

This was not their original destination, but after trying a couple ways of fixing it (no success) an being yanked off the project, I don't have time 
to fix their stored directory.

In any event, the only reason my program does not auto-delete them is because if anyone wants (or moans that) IT should resend the document, and 
doesn't beleive their emails, the files can still be pulled from this directory.
